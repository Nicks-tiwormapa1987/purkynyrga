OMG – I just walked out of that movie, Kesari Chapter 2, and my brain's still buzzing like a wild beehive! You know, like those old-school radio channels nonsensically glitching? That’s my brain right now. So many things to unpack, like my backpack after a backpacking trip in the middle of nowhere. The Untold Story of Jallianwala Bagh? More like the emotional ambush of the century. 

Okay, first thing – the visuals. Pure, vivid fire. Like, metaphorically, literally... every way possible. My back's killing me because I was practically glued to the edge of the seat the whole time. I think I've got popcorn bits stuck behind me from that random kid who decided the air was a better target than his mouth. But dude, that opening scene! Flames lit up entire screens. It was like being slapped with 50 shades of saffron and chaos. Like swimming through syrupy madness. And the sound? Felt it vibrate in my bones, random lady next to me dropped her soda. 

> That one scene where they showed Udham Singh, standing eerily silent before the massacre erupted... chills. Literal goosebumps like being stuck in a freezer, except I was there in a theater with popcorn sticky floors, right. All this visceral detail blending with splotches of history. Like my brain trying to piece together a huge jigsaw puzzle while riding a roller coaster.

Acting? Man, tight as a drum. Folks were asking if they should download the movie before it even hit cinemas. I’d say watch the movie in all its bigger-than-life ambition. The actors had this magnetic screen presence that sucked the life outta reality for a couple of hours.

I kept thinking how watching this movie was like being on public transport during rush hour squeezed in on all sides, except instead of people, it’s gut-wrenching emotions. Felt my heart quickening pace — so many feels, like riding a rollercoaster with no brakes. So raw and... and... grating on the nerves like nails scratching down a chalkboard, but in like, the best Jacobian way possible. 

> Wasn’t expecting those transitions either, between serene moments and utter chaos. Felt like time-traveling with whiplash. Quick suggestion - maybe just watch this one in theaters? The sound, my God, lost my eardrums somewhere in there.

If only you could hear rather than read. Oh right, someone did ask if they could, like, download the movie. But visuals and surround sound, supreme stuff, best experienced in the moment when you’re engulfed in darkness and screen light. Makes home viewing seem like decaf coffee when you need an espresso.

Oh, and one quote from the film keeps looping in my head. Something about wounds remembered. Hell, sitting there with my spine twisted for 3 hours, definitely gonna remember this ache. Almost feels poetic, like a weirdly pleasant hangover lining my brain. 

Anyway gotta love it when a film randomly nudges existential thoughts. You sit there thinking you're just getting history and BAM! you're questioning life choices. Life's weird sometimes. You know what isn't though... Python.

```python
for memory in film
    if emotion == high:
        thought.append(random)
    time.sleep(5)
end.writing()
```
